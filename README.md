Homeo is a software simulation  inspired by   W.R. Ashby's Homeostat device as described in his books _Design for a Brain_ and _Introduction to Cybernetics_.

Homeo  includes a simulation of all the  components of Ashby's original Homeostat (Units, Uniselectors, etc), plus 
- a Gui front-end that allows  runnning the interactive manipulation of the simulated device
- Data-logging facilities
-Graphing capabilities of the logged data

Homeo extends Ashby's original models to an unlimited number of Homeostatic units, and it generalizes and supplement Ashby's model of a homeostatic unit.

Homeo also includes a robotic component that allows a homeostat to be used as the controller of virtual robots built in robotic simulation software.
