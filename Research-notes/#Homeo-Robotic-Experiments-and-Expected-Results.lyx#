\begin_layout Title
Discussion of Homeo Robotic Experiments and expected results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Stefano Franchi

\begin_layout Abstract
A note to myself detailing the homeostatic architectures of the different
 vehicle involved in the Homeo robotic experiments, together with expected
 results (and, eventually, actual results)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This series of notes discusses the various experiments to be carried with
 Homeo joined to a simulated robotic environment (Webots).
 Its main goal is to clearly identify, for each experimental setup, the
 environmental setup (the Webots world, and what it stands for), the homeostatic
 architecture (number and type of units), the expected behaviors, and, if
 possible, the expected dynamics.
 It will start with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

simplest possible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 homeostatic creature: a Braitenberg-like type 1 vehicle with one sensory
 opening to the world and one actuator (motor).
 With some approximation, it may resemble a biological agent carrying out
 chemotaxis.
 These notes will then discuss Brainteberg-like type 2 vehicles carrying
 out phototaxis, and multimodal creatures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Environment 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a flat world with no obstacle and no perturbations (i.e.
 no buffeting from external forces such as those that a living organism
 carrying out chemotaxis may experience).
 The environment presents a stimulus gradient of an unspecified kind which
 is simulated by one or more light sources.
 The organism/vehicle has 
\emph on
one 
\emph default
sensory input tuned to the stimulus (i.e.
 a light sensor) and one actuator allowing one dimensional translation (i.e.
 a motor connected to a wheel that can spin either forward or backward).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Homeostatic setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As discussed in other notes, there are two possible setups: a 2 unit setup
 with a sensor unit and a motor/actuator unit and a 1 unit setup with only
 a motor unit connected to a sensory interface (these two setups corresponds
 to Ashby second and, respectively, first experiment in 
\emph on
Design for a Brain
\emph default
).
 The main difference between the two setups is that the 2-unit architecture
 allows 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

input-modulation,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so to speak: the organism may change its sensitivity to the external stimulus
 by changing the parameter controlling the the percentage of the input that
 is transmitted to the other unit.
 No such input modulation exists for the alternative setup.

Let us analyze the behavior of the vehicle by first reducing it to its simplest
 possible setup, and then gradually adding additional features:

\end_inset

 the self-connections (
\begin_inset Formula $S\rightarrow S$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M\rightarrow M$
\end_inset

), we obtain an approximation of a Braitenberg type-1 vehicle (see point
 below for why it is an approximation).
 This vehicle will transmit directly its input to to its output motor.
 If the

perceived

 stimulus is directly proportional to the stimulus source, it will therefore
 move

from it.
 If on the contrary, the perceived stimulus is 
\emph on
inversely
\emph default
 proportional to the source, it will move 
\emph on
toward

it.
 Put it differently, the direct proportional setup vehicle will

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Because a HomeoUnit is a

 object: the input is a force (torque) that changes its velocity, not its
 position.
 A true Braitenberg vehicle would have to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aristotelian,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with input affecting its position, not its velocity.
 As a Newtonian physical laws approximate Aristotelian laws whenever friction
 forces are high, and the equivalent of friction forces in Homeo units is
 the viscosity of the medium the needle moves in, it follows that by increasing
 the viscosity we would come closer to a

 result.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another important difference between the Homeo setup and Braitenberg's.
 The range of values of a Homeo unit is centered around 0, whereas the range
 of values of a Braitenberg's vehicle is always positive.
 If, as in the current setup, the Homeo unit's is directly transmitted to
 the output (just scaled), then the robot's actuator may receive both positive
 and negative values, which would translate in the robot moving forward
 or, respectively, backward.
 A truly analogous Braitenberg vehicle would convert the value of the motor
 unit to positive actuator commands instead of simply scaling them to the
 appropriate range.

Braitenberg-like Type 1 vehicle in an environmental stimulus gradient.
 The spherical gradient identified the environmental stimulus, centered
 on the red dot.
 The external green circle represent the minimum possible stimulus.
 This will be equal to zero in a traditional Braitenberg vehicle, whereas
 it will be negative and equal to the minimum possible value (which is always
 negative) of the sensory unit in the standard Homeo setup.
 The red circle indicates the threshold value equal to exactly half the
 value of the stimulus, which is equivalent to exactly 0 in the standard
 Homeo setup.
 Notice that the red circle may not be halfway between the center of the
 gradient and the green line, and its position depends on the chosen stimulus's
 decay rule (which, for light, is inversely quadratic).

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming the perceived stimulus is directly proportional to the input stimulus,
 we would observe the following behaviors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A true Braitenberg vehicle---and a true 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aristotelian
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Homeo unit with always positive actuator commands, as discussed above---will
 keep moving straight until its input is zero (or sufficiently close to
 zero, tasking into account that the Webots software does provide some simulatio
n for frictional forces acting on the robot).
 The robot will keep moving until the gradient's value is 0, where it'll
 stop.
 If the gradient never reaches zero, it'll keep moving forward (at least,
 until the sensory input's falls below the minimal threshold needed to overcome
 frictional forces/inertia).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A Newtonian unit will behave differently.
 A damped Newtonian unit will not stop as soon as the input reaches 0.
 It will gradually slow down under the effect of its internal friction (i.e.
 the viscosity of the medium).
 In practice, it will overshoot the target by a distance inversely proportional
 to its viscosity parameter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally, an 
\emph on
undamped
\emph default
 Newtonian unit (a unity with no viscosity) will never stop.
 It will keep going indefinitely with a theoretical 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

terminal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 velocity dependent on the accumulated input.
 However, given that the value of a unit (and, hence, the value of its actuator,
 i.e.
 the value of the motor command) is constrained within a Max/Min band, its
 terminal velocity will be equal to the unit's maximum value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If, instead, the setup is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aristotelian,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but the actuator commands are either positive or negative as in the standard
 Homeo configuration, the behavior will be different and it will depend
 on the unit's initial position with respect to the gradient.
 Consider vehicle A in figure 
\begin_inset Flex ShortXRef

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Its initial input will be less than 0, since it lies outside the red circle.
 Hence it will immediately move away from the input source, i.
 e.
 backward (to the left, in the diagram).
 In the absence of other stimulus sources, it will keep moving backward
 indefinitely.
 Consider instead vehicle B.
 It start within the red circle, hence its input will be positive and it
 will move forward until it crosses the red circle on the right side of
 the diagram, when its input will reach 0 and the vehicle will stop.
 In other words, the behavior is sensitive to initial conditions.
 If the starting point is past the half-way point of the gradient's value,
 the vehicle will effectively seek such a halfway point, otherwise it will
 move away from the gradient indefinitely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Similar consideration applies to non-Aristotelian setups.
 A damped Newtonian vehicle starting outside the red circle (case A in the
 diagram) will accelerate away and reach terminal velocity.
 A similar vehicle starting inside the red circle (case B), will overshoot
 the red circle on the opposite side, then correct backward, etcetera.
 In short it will converge harmonically on the red line on the right side
 of the diagram.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally an undamped unit will accelerate away (backward) in case A, whereas
 in case B it will accelerate rigthward (forward), then reverse acceleration
 when it crosses the red line.
 It should converge on the red line as in the previous case, but with a
 much less stable behavior (i.e.
 ampler oscillations).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If, on the contrary, the perceived stimulus is inversely proportional to
 the input, we would observe the reverse behavior.
 That is, the behavior will be analogous except that the target respectively
 reached or overshot will be the point in the vehicle's path where the value
 is equal to zero:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A true Braitenberg vehicle will keep moving as long as the input is 
\emph on
not 
\emph default
zero.
 It will effectively climb up the gradient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A damped Newtonian unit will overshoot its gradient equal to zero target
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, an undamped unit will keep going---whether it reaches the terminal
 velocity equal to its max value depends on the initial distance between
 units and gradient's maximum value.

 Let us also stipulate that the value of the self-connection will be moderately
 negative (of the order of
