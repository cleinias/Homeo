The goal of this note is to show how to translate into a real (or simulated)
 environment the physico-biological setup that the simplest, non-trivial
 Homeostat represents.
 We take as our starting point the classic 2-Unit Homeostat featured in
 Ashby's first experiment (demonstrating

 The connection between the agent and the environment (A
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

E) represent the agent's capacity to affect (or manipulate) its environment.
 More precisely, it represents the agent's capacity to manipulate its relationsh
ip to the environment, including its location in it.
 Hence it stands for the agent's motor skills (of whichever kind and very
 broadly conceived).
 In perhaps the simplest possible case, it may stand for the agent's capacity
 to move around and therefore change its relative position within a given
 environment.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This definition is so general to actually include any kind of relative movement,
 whether the agent is endowed with locomotion or not.
 For instance a plant's leaf capacity to turn in the direction of the incoming
 light during phototropism is as valid a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

motor action
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as a bacterium's flagellate action during chemotaxis.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Conversely, the connection between the environment and the agent (E
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

A) represents the environment's capacity to affect or, more generally, somewhat
 influence the agent.
 To be more precise, E
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

A represents the possible action of the environment upon the agent from
 the 
\emph on
agent's point of view
\emph default
.
 In other words, it represents those changes in the environment that the
 agent is open to: it stands for some kind of sensory channel, very broadly
 conceived.
 The A
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

A connection represents some kind of self-limiting (if its value is negative)
 or self-amplifying (if positive) control of the agent upon itself and its
 value may be zero (i.e.
 it may not exist).
 Similarly, the E
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

E connection represents some kind of self-limiting/self-amplifying control
 of the environment upon itself, as it were (or, in an alternate reading,
 of the agent's sensitivity to the environment.

There are 4 parameters describing this simple 2 units setup, corresponding
 to the weights of the four connections just listed.
 Additionally, there is another set of 2nd order parameters describing how
 the previous 4 may be modified.
 For simplicity, and in or order to stay close to Ashby's original experiment,
 we consider this second set of parameters to consist of just a series of
 binary values specifying whether each one of the 4 possible connection
 is subject to an automatic resetting when the unit's value exceed its limits.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In general, this is not necessarily the case.
 The second-order feedback loop that modifies the values of the first-order
 connection may be controlled by numerous parameters, such as the amount
 of time-delay (how often the unit's variable is checked), the function
 used to change the first-order parameters, and so on.
 However, these parameters were hard-wired in Ashby's physical machine,
 hence the reduction of this second-order parameters to a binary value.

 In summary, the weight of the 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow E$
\end_inset

 connection modulates the agent's motor action, while the weight of the
 
\begin_inset Formula $E\rightarrow A$
\end_inset

 modulates the sensory action 
\emph on

 the agent.
 The remaining two connections, 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E\rightarrow E$
\end_inset

, modulate, respectively, the agent's and the environment's overall reaction
 (i.e.
 acting as either a damping factor or as an amplifier).

One unit equivalent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When converting Ashby's setup to a real physical setting, the first choice
 is to to eliminate the unit corresponding to the Environment and to replace
 it with environment itself.
 The choice seems natural because it takes the equilibrium value of the
 Agent unit as the only meaningful equilibrium in the system, therefore
 eliminating the Environment unit and its associated equilibrium.
 On the other hand, the choice is not without its problems.
 First, the Homeostat did indeed have two units and 2 associated equilibrium
 values---it seems we are discarding some important element that was perhaps
 not properly discussed earlier.
 Second, this choice seem to run into an obvious issue when scaled up.
 Imagine a system with several motor and input channels all connected to
 an agent.
 In a classic Ashbian representation, the system would be modeled as a Homeostat
 comprising several units.
 In this translation, however, all the units except the agent would disappear,
 and we would have a one unit Homeostat.
 This seems unsatisfactory and needs further discussion.
 This section explores this choice before moving to a discussion of an alternati
ve.

The Agent unit is therefore the only unit left.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow E$
\end_inset

 connection is some form of motor action capable of modifying the relationship
 between the agent and the environment.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $E\rightarrow A$
\end_inset

 connection, in turn, is some form of sensory input from the environment.
 What about the other 2 connections in the original Homeostat? The 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow A$
\end_inset

 connection remain.
 It represents the self-control of the agent.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $E\rightarrow E$
\end_inset

 connection, instead, should be gone as well.
 It could be interpreted as a feedback loop on the sensory input source,
 roughly acting as a self-amplifier or self-damping factor.
 But in that case it would be a second

 and the second one representing a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

sensor neuron.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 This possibility is discussed below.
 Notice that this possibility seems to correspond, in Ashby's terms, to
 a 3-Unit Homeostat connected in series, and not to to a 2-Unit one.

 As this value must come from the

 There are a few difficulties in this translation.
 First of all, and perhaps most importantly, it is not clear at all what
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $M\rightarrow S$
\end_inset

 connection may stand for.
 The action must be mediated by the environment---or rather, it must be
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 action affecting the environment, and that is already taken care by the
 connection of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 to the output unit.
 It seems obvious that the 
\begin_inset Formula $M\rightarrow S$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
direct 
\emph default
connection must be eliminated.
 But this, in turn, seems to break the full-connection of the network, which
 may be seen as an important part of Ashby's model (it certainly is an important
 part of 
\noun on
ctrnn
\noun default
's).
 Unless we consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $M\rightarrow output\: unit$
\end_inset

 as a part of the network, which it is from a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

substantial
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 point of view, but it is 
\emph on
formally 
\emph default
not.
 Indeed, this arrangement, once the 
\begin_inset Formula $M\rightarrow S$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
direct 
\emph default
connection is removed, looks remarkably similar to a Braitenberg type-1
 vehicle, with the addition of self-connections and uniselectors.
 At least it is closer to a Braitenberg's than to a standard 
\noun on
ctrnn
\noun default
 network.
 In short, the network in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "fig:Real-world-translation-2nd-option"

\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fully connected
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 only if we assume that a connection could go through the environment, as
 the indirect 
\begin_inset Formula $M\rightarrow S$
\end_inset

 does.
 Mathematically, this means that the isomorphism between a homeostat must
 be modified to account for such 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

indirect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 connections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second problem concerns the interpretation of the uniselector on the
 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 unit.
 On the one hand, according to Ashby's theory, an organism's unit must be
 ultrastable, hence it must have the capacity to randomly reset its own
 connection weights.
 It follows that it must have a uniselector.
 On the other hand, what would be its function? If we remove the incoming
 
\begin_inset Formula $M\rightarrow S$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
direct 
\emph default
connection, as suggested above, 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

's two 
\emph on
modifiable
\emph default
 connections are the self-connection 
\begin_inset Formula $S\rightarrow S$
\end_inset

 and the outgoing 
\begin_inset Formula $S\rightarrow M$
\end_inset

 (since the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sensor unit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is just a transducer that transmits the full input coming from the environment
 with no modification possible).
 As the only real input to 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 comes from the outside world (the 
\begin_inset Formula $S\rightarrow S$
\end_inset

 being a modulator of the external input), it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 can only enter a critical status and therefore trigger its uniselector
 if the external input is too low or too high.
 Suppose it is too high, meaning the organism is too close to the input
 source.
 The value could be brought back within normal range by:
\end_layout

Ashby says that the

diagram of immediate effects was 
\begin_inset Formula $1\rightleftarrows2$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $1\rightarrow2$

\begin_inset Formula $2\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 was uniselector-controlled
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (DoB, 2nd ed., p.105).
 I take it that he means the unit 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

has a uniselector, and unit 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 does not, as the diagram he has on the same page indicates.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This would mean that none of the three options listed above actually obtains
 in Ashby's model, and would thereby suggest that the translation closer
 to his setup is the one-unit option we detailed in the previous section.
 This can be verified by noticing that if we remove the self-connection,
 as it was done in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "fig:Real-World-Ashby-1"

\end_inset

, we obtain a diagram that is virtually identical to the option depicted
 in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "fig:Real-world-translation"

\end_inset

.
 (In reality, we do not really need to remove it: we can still assume that
 the unit may be self-connected.
 However, since the value of the self-connection is fixed, the uniselector
 being missing, it is equivalent to a constant value added or subtracted
 from the only input coming into the unit.
 In other words, a fixed self-connection is equivalent to a constant being
 added to the weight of the only incoming connection.
 Functionally speaking, it is absent)

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A conclusion wrapping up the two translations is still missing.
 In brief: translation 1 seems closer to Ashby's spirit, but it is rather
 far from the spirit of modern 
\noun on
ctrnn
\noun default
's and neural networks in general.
 Translation 2, conversely, is closer to 
\noun on
ctrnn
\noun default
's and 
\noun on
nn
\noun default
's but, in its complete form, has elements (such as a uniselector-controlled
 self-connection) that seem physico-biologically implausible or at least
 of difficult interpretation.
 Once the second translation has been simplified as per Ashby's text in
 example 1, it reduced to the first one.

I need to consider the possibility---already hinted at by Ashby---that the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 represents not a neuron but some kind of higher functional unit.
 This would mean, in terms of implementation, that a Homeo unit could be
 translated to 
\emph on
several 
\emph default
\noun on
ctrnn
\noun default
's neurons, even though the overall behavior of the net would have to follow
 the ultrastability/general homestasis principles the real homeostat follows.
 Check out, for instance, the early description by Beer and Gallagher 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "BeerGallagher1992"

\end_inset

, where the agent performing the chemotaxis task they describe is implemented
 in terms of 6 neurons: 2 sensory neurons, two motor neurons and 
\emph on
two fully connected internal neurons
\emph default
.
 In Ashby's terms, we would have to decide which of the subcollections of
 neurons actually represents an ultrastable homeostat 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unit.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The internal 2-neurons network? The whole assemblage? The 2+2 subunit of
 effectors+internal neurons?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Consider the one-neuron first translation depicted in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:First-translation"

\end_inset

.
 This organism will only receive an input from the outside world and will
 try to minimize it at all costs, operating on its effector.
 Since the input represents some stimulus from the outside (intensity of
 a chemical gradient, or of a light gradient, etcetera), the organism will
 run away from it and be a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gradient darkness-seeker
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or, in Braitenberg's terms, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shy creature.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Viceversa, if the stimulus consists in a proximity value (e.g.
 from a proximity sensor), the organism will be a very primitive 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

roamer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: it will try to move away from obstacles (in a very limited fashion, of
 course, given the unidimensionality of its effector).
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
However, consider that it is impossible to design an organism with the opposite
 behavior and identical setup.
 In other words: no change of parameters will ever turn a (gradient) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

darkness-seeker
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into a (gradient) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

light seeker.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Given that the input from a chemical/light sensor is positive, the creature
 will always run away from it.
 Viceversa for the

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: it is impossible to turn into a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 that will look for objects and cling to them.
 The only way to change the behavior of the organism is to change the physical/b
iological nature of the sensory input coming into it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This conclusion may mean that an increase in flexibility may require a different
 and more complex setup.
 For instance, it may mean that the sensitivity to chemical/photo stimuli
 must first be converted into a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

proximity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 measure (which may just be the reciprocal of the stimulus, roughly speaking).
 And this means that a neural apparatus (perhaps a self-standing homeostat?)
 has to be devoted to it.
 Perhaps a 2-neuron agent such as the one depicted in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, equivalent to a 3-unit homeostat, will be sufficient?
