    '''
    HomeoUniselectorAshby is a different implementation of Ashby's (sparsely described!) algorithm.
    It simulates a stepping switch (or Uniselector) that advances one step every time it is activated.
    At every step the uniselector produces weight values for the HomeoUnits connections. 
    The simulation is implemented  with a m x n matrix (the ivar matrix) where m 
    are the steps of the uniselector, and n are the number of connected units. 
    In Ashby's classical homeostat m= 25, n = 3.  The values in the matrix are produced according 
    to three different algorithms, each a different intepretation of Ashby's original idea. 
    The parameter deciding which production method to use is held in ashbyKind.

    Instance Variables:
    unitsControlled <anInteger>       The maximum number of units this uniselector controls. Default values is 10. It will be incremented in 10-units increment if needed
    unitIndex       <anInteger>        The index keeping track of which unit's connection we are currently producing a value (a weight) for.
    ashbyKind       <aString>          The string determining which initialization (and re-initialization) method to use.
    unitIndex
    interval
    steps        <anInteger>       The number of possible steps in the Uniselector (default is 12, as per Ashby's implementation)
    index        <anInteger>       The index keeping track of which row of weight we should output next
    matrix        <aMatrix>       A matrix of size (unitsControlled x steps) holding all the possible weights
